 Chocolate Sales: Optimal Pricing and Demand Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes chocolate sales data to estimate product-level demand, calculate optimal prices, and maximize revenue using price elasticity.

## Tools and Skills
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels)
- Regression Analysis
- Elasticity-based Pricing

## Key Findings
- Optimal prices were derived for individual products based on linear demand estimation.
- Elasticity and revenue optimization principles were applied formally.

## Results
| Product | Optimal Price | Optimal Quantity |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Almond Choco | $90.65 | 102 boxes |
| Mint Chip Choco | $90.16 | 127 boxes |
